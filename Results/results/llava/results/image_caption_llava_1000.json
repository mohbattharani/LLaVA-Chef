The olive oil, Dijon mustard, fresh lemon juice, orange rind, salt, and pepper work together to create a rich, tangy, and slightly sweet glaze that coats the salmon steaks evenly. The baking process ensures that the fish is cooked to perfection, and the glaze caramelizes and becomes slightly crispy on the surface. The resting time allows the flavors to meld together, making the dish even more enjoyable."
